tiddlywiki-splitter
===================

Split a TiddlyWiki into multiple text files, one file per tiddler.

A TiddlyWiki (http://tiddlywiki.com) can be great for keeping notes.  However,
it keeps everything in a single file, and can become difficult to manage when
the volume of notes gets large.

This project splits a TiddlyWiki into multiple text files.  The files can then
be imported into vim.notes (https://github.com/xolox/vim-notes) or an
alternative note-keeping solution.
